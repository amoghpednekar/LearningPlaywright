# Learning Playwright - Automation Mastery

Welcome to the **Learning Playwright** repository! 🚀

This project is dedicated to mastering **Playwright** for web automation, starting from the absolute basics of JavaScript and Node.js setup to advanced automation concepts.

## 📂 Repository Structure

### Chapter 1: Basics & Setup
This section covers the fundamental building blocks required before diving into Playwright automation.

- **`01_Basics.js`**: A simple introductory script to verify that code execution is working.
- **`02_Js_step_by_step.js`**: Basic JavaScript variable declaration and console logging.
- **`03_Verify_Setup.js`**: specifically designed to verify your Node.js environment configuration (Platform, Architecture, and Node Version).
- **`04_Verify_hotcode.js`**: A demonstration of how JavaScript engines (like V8) handle "hot code" vs. optimizing code execution paths.

### Chapter 2: Core JavaScript Concepts
This section dives into the core mechanics of JavaScript which are essential for understanding how scripts behave in Playwright.

- **`05_JS_core_comments.js`**: Explains the different types of comments in JavaScript.
- **`06_indentifier_JS_core.js`**: Covers rules and best practices for naming identifiers in JavaScript.
- **`07_var_let_const.js`**: Introduction to variable declarations using `var`, `let`, and `const`.
- **`08_lab.js`**: A practical lab exercise for applying variable concepts.
- **`09_Hoisting.js`**: An overview of the Hoisting mechanism in JavaScript.
- **`10_hoisting_var.js`**: Demonstrates how `var` declarations are hoisted.
- **`11_hoisting_function.js`**: Explains function hoisting behavior.
- **`12_hoisting_let.js`**: Discusses hoisting with `let` and the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ).
- **`13_Hoisting_let_block.js`**: Explores block scoping and hoisting with `let`.
- **`14_hoisting_const.js`**: Details how `const` behaves with hoisting and initialization.
